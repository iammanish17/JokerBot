A Discord entertainment bot with lots of cool and fun games to kill your time. Created for the Discord Hack Week 2019, by manish#9999.

## How to setup?
1) Create a Discord Bot and get it's token. You can check out the tutorial [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) to know how.
2) Add your token in the config.json in the 'token' key.
3) Upload 11.png (in the emojis folder) as an emoji in your server, and add the ID of that emoji in the '11' key. Follow the same process for 12, 13, 14 and 15 respectively, and your config file is ready now.
4) Install all the required libraries using:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5) Run the `bot.py` file and your bot will start running.
